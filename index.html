    <h1>Guazábara TTRPG</h1>

    <p><strong>Guazabara</strong> is a battle system for <strong>BoneDust RPG</strong>, designed to recreate the feel of life-or-death skirmishes in a narrative-focused environment. The rules focus on simplicity and tactical engagement with high stakes in combat.</p>

    <h2>Basic Combat Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic Hits:</strong> In Guazabara, every attack automatically hits. Instead of rolling to hit, players roll for <strong>damage</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Hits & Fumbles:</strong> If a player rolls maximum damage, they score a <strong>critical hit</strong>. If they roll a <code>1</code> on damage, it results in a <strong>fumble</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Armor in Guazabara reduces the damage taken from attacks. The armor’s reduction value is subtracted from the damage before it is applied to the character’s HP.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Multi-Attacks</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>When multiple characters attack the same target, each rolls their damage dice and keeps the highest result.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>This rule simulates the intensity of group attacks, where a swarm of combatants could overwhelm a single foe.</p>

    <h2>Combat Phases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Declare Actions:</strong> At the start of each combat round, players declare their actions. This could include moving, attacking, casting a spell, or other combat actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Initiative:</strong> Players roll a d20 for initiative. Actions are resolved in order of initiative, from highest to lowest.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolve Actions:</strong> Actions are then resolved according to the declared intent and rolled damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply Damage:</strong> Damage is applied after accounting for armor and other effects. If a critical or fumble occurs, narrate its dramatic effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Combat Maneuvers</h2>
    <p>In addition to basic attacks, characters can attempt the following combat maneuvers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Disarm:</strong> Roll a d20. If successful (under the related stat), the enemy drops their weapon.</li>
        <li><strong>Grapple:</strong> Roll a d20. Success allows a character to grapple an enemy, pinning them and preventing action.</li>
        <li><strong>Push:</strong> Attempt to push the target, forcing them to move back or fall. Success is determined by a roll against the target's Might or Agility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Morale & Retreat</h2>
    <p>At the GM's discretion, when enemies lose half their numbers or the leader falls, they must make a <strong>morale check</strong>. Failing the check may cause them to flee the battle or surrender.</p>
