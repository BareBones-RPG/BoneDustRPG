        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Guazabara is the combat system for BoneDust RPG. It focuses on fast-paced, lethal, and narrative-driven action, encouraging creative problem-solving and tactical decision-making.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Initiative</h2>
        <p>Initiative in Guazabara is group-based. The Referee will decide if enemies act first, or if Player Characters do based on the circumstances. In certain situations, a D20 roll can determine initiative, with the higher result winning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Attacks</h2>
        <p>In Guazabara, attacks always hit. Damage is rolled based on the weapon used. If the damage die rolls its maximum value, the hit is considered a critical hit. Rolling a 1 on the damage die is considered a fumble.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Multi-attacks:</strong> When multiple characters attack a single target, all attackers roll their damage dice, and the highest roll is taken.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Armor</h2>
        <p>Armor reduces damage taken. Different armors absorb different amounts of damage, which is subtracted from incoming attacks. Once an armor's reduction is exceeded, any remaining damage affects the character’s hit points.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <p>Distances are categorized into three ranges: Close, Near, and Far. Players can move between ranges in a single action depending on their situation and narrative context.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Critical Hits and Fumbles</h2>
        <p>If a player rolls a maximum on their damage die, it is a critical hit, dealing maximum damage and triggering additional narrative effects as determined by the Referee. A roll of 1 on a damage die is a fumble, and something goes wrong.</p>
