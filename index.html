<p>BoneDust RPG is a simplified RPG that uses a <strong>20-sided die</strong> against a character's ability. This game's combat can be lethal. The Referee will award players for thinking outside the box. It is meant to be narrative-focused with simple mechanics, only rolling for risky situations against a character's ability score.</p>
 <h2>What Do You Need?</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>This game <strong>needs 2-4 players</strong> and one acting as <strong>the referee</strong>.</li>
 <li><em>Pencil, Dice set, and piece of paper or Index Cards</em> for character record keeping.</li>
 <li>A Battle map with mini figs or tokens that represent their character.</li>
 <li>Or use Theater of the Mind kind of play.</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
 <p>The Referee will narrate and present opportunities for players to interact with <em>NPCs, monsters, and the world</em>. Whenever a player character does something <strong>risky or uncertain</strong>, they will roll a <strong>d20</strong> and aim for a result that is <strong>equal to or lower than</strong> their relevant ability score.</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Rolling a 1 is always a <strong>critical success</strong>.</li>
 <li>Rolling a 20 is always a <strong>fumble</strong>.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Test</h3>
 <p>A test occurs whenever a player character attempts a risky action, such as sneaking past a guard, or picking a lock. Examples of situations that require a test include:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Checking for traps</li>
 <li>Forcing open a locked door</li>
 <li>Resisting a magical charm</li>
 <li>Being dishonest with an NPC</li>
 <li>Jumping across a chasm</li>
 <li>Attempting to continue combat after reaching 0 Hit Points</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Boon and Bane</h3>
 <p>Boons and Banes modify the standard test roll in situations where a character has an advantage or disadvantage:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Boon</strong>: Roll 2d20 and keep the lower result (2d20kl). This is used when the character has a favorable situation, such as using appropriate gear.</li>
 <li><strong>Bane</strong>: Roll 2d20 and keep the higher result (2d20kh). This is used when the character is in a disadvantageous situation, such as when they have a condition affecting their ability.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Example:</strong> A character with an Agility of 12 is attempting to sneak past a guard in a poorly lit area. They have a cloak that grants them a Boon when sneaking. They roll 2d20 and get a 15 and a 9. They keep the lower result (9). Since 9 is lower than their Agility of 12, they succeed at the test and sneak past the guards.</p>
 <h4>Gear Assistance</h4>
 <p>When a player character uses gear that helps with a test, they will roll with a <strong>Boon</strong>. This roll is then compared against their relevant attribute to see if they are successful.</p>
 <p><strong>For Example:</strong> A character with an Agility of 12 is attempting to sneak past a guard in a poorly lit area. They have a cloak that grants them a bonus when sneaking. They roll 2d20 and get a 15 and a 9. They keep the lower result (9). Since 9 is lower than their Agility of 12, they succeed at the test. The player character can sneak past the guards and enter the ballroom.</p>
 <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Most Gear can help with a Boon, depending on the state of the item it can negate the boon. Thus, this will make the roll from 2d20KL to just rolling a d20.</p>
 <h3>Pushing Rolls</h3>
 <p>Whenever a player fails a Test roll, they have the option to <strong>push their roll</strong>, re-rolling the test but at a risk. If the player chooses to push, they must accept the new roll's result, and their character gains a <strong>condition</strong>.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> These represent the strain or harm suffered by the character when pushing beyond their limits. The condition imposes a Bane on future rolls related to the affected ability until it is removed after a long rest or narratively appropriate recovery.
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Agility:</strong><em>Dazed</em></li>
 <li><strong>Insight:</strong><em>Frustrated</em></li>
 <li><strong>Might:</strong><em>Fatigued</em></li>
 <li><strong>Willpower:</strong><em>Scared</em></li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Author Notes:</strong> A fumble roll cannot be pushed. However, when a spell caster rolls a fumble, they may sacrifice some of their Hit Points to activate their spell. The caster decides how much power to force into the spell, with the effect depending on the amount of Hit Points sacrificed. The <em>Referee or Player</em> can roll for the effect.</p>
 <ul>
 <li>d4: Minor effect (half damage/effect)</li>
 <li>d6: Regular effect (normal damage/effect)</li>
 <li>d8: Major effect (double damage/effect)</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Dealing with Conditions</h4>
 <p>Conditions represent negative effects that hinder a character's abilities. They impose a Bane on all relevant tests. These conditions can be cured or mitigated with rest, specific items, or a successful spell.</p>
 <h2>Character Creation</h2>
 <p>Players will roll <strong>3 six-sided dice</strong> down the line and note the results on their character sheet. All PCs begin with:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>three days' rations (one slot)</li>
 <li>A torch (one slot)</li>
 <li>3d6 Gold Pieces</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Generating Max Hit Points</h3>
 <p>Players will roll a d6 and add their MIGHT score to the roll to <strong>calculate Max HP.</strong></p>
 <h3>What Abilities Do You Use?</h3>
 <p><em>BoneDust</em> uses <strong>4 abilities</strong> that represent each <em>test in the game</em>.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>AGILITY:</strong> Used for balancing, swimming, and fleeing.</li>
 <li><strong>INSIGHT:</strong> Used for Charming, perceiving, and spellcasting.</li>
 <li><strong>MIGHT:</strong> Used for crushing, lifting, striking, grappling, and resisting poison.</li>
 <li><strong>WILLPOWER:</strong> Used for resolve, rituals, and resisting mental influence.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Combat</h3>
 <p>Players should avoid going to combat. This is dangerous! Characters will have to roll to see who goes first. If the character rolls a result that meets or is under their <strong>AGILITY score</strong>, they will go first. If the player is over their score, the enemy will go first.</p>
 <p>Player Characters do not roll to hit when attacking. Both sides will automatically hit. They will roll the weapon's damage die. If the player character rolls a 1, this is a fumble. If the player character rolls max damage, it is a <strong>critical</strong>. <em>Critical damage</em> will bring down enemies or the player character's armor 1 tier down. A <strong>fumble roll</strong> means the enemy or player character's weapon will lose quality until the weapon is broken.</p>
 <p>Whenever multiple Player Characters or enemies attack one target, they all roll their damage die and keep the highest result.</p>
 <h4>Movement in Combat</h4>
 <p>Movement is categorized into three distances:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Close:</strong> This is within melee range. All player characters can move and attack within this range.</li>
 <li><strong>Near:</strong> This is within throwing range. Player characters must move to close the distance.</li>
 <li><strong>Far:</strong> Player characters will have to double their movement to reach the near range and move closer to the enemy.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Morale</h3>
 <p>When players face enemies, the referee can use <strong>morale</strong> to determine if the enemy stays or flees. When the enemy leader is defeated, or the enemy loses half of its hit points, the player can roll 2d6 for a morale check. If the result is higher than the DR (Difficulty Rating), the enemy will flee.</p>
 <h2>Armor</h2>
 <p>Armor helps players explore dangerous situations, from man to monster. Some armor can absorb more damage than others. When armor is hit, it will reduce the amount of damage taken but will also lose 1 tier. When the armor reaches 0 tiers, it is broken and must be repaired.</p>
 <h2>Magic</h2>
 <p>Spellcasters can learn a number of spells based on their Insight stat. Spells require focus and vocal casting, and the player must roll a d20 against their Insight to cast the spell. Rolling equal to or under their Insight score results in a successful cast, while rolling above it means the spell fails. A critical success (rolling a 1) might result in a more potent effect, while a fumble (rolling a 20) could lead to a dangerous backfire.</p>
 <h3>Rituals</h3>
 <p>Rituals are lengthy ceremonies relying on Willpower. The player must roll a d20 against their Willpower to perform the ritual successfully. If successful, the ritual takes effect. Rituals are powerful but require time, specific components, and sometimes favorable conditions.</p>
 <h3>Advancement</h3>
 <p>Characters advance by surviving dangerous situations and marking the stats they used during the session. At the end of the session, the player rolls a d20 for each marked stat. If they roll above the current stat's value, they may increase it by 1 point, representing the character's growth and learning.</p>
